  <h1>Renaming Working Copy Items</h1>
  <p>Rename items in a working copy using one of the following methods:</p>
  <div class="task">
  	<ol>
  		<li>Select the item to rename and then single-click the item to start editing the name</li>
  		<li>Select the item to rename and press the <span class="key">Return</span> (⏎) key.</li>
  		<li>Confirm the pressing the <span class="key">Return</span> (⏎) key or clicking on another item in the browser.</li>
  		<li>You can cancel the rename at any time by pressing the <span class="key">Escape</span> (⎋) key.</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  <p>Subversion implements a rename as a move operation. As a result, the original file is marked for deletion and added to the working copy with the new name.</p>    
  <h2>Undoing a Rename</h2>
  <p>You can use the <span class="uiref">Revert</span> function to undo a rename using the following steps:</p>
  <div class="task">
  	<ol>
  		<li>Select the original file which was scheduled for deletion and revert it to the BASE version using the <span class="uiref">Revert</span> function. The file is restored to the BASE version and is no longer scheduled for deletion.</li>
  		<li>Select the file that is scheduled for addition to the repository and remove the file using the <span class="uiref">Delete</span> function.</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Committing a Rename</h2>
  <div class="note">
  <p>In order to preserve the rename operation correctly in the repository&rsquo;s history, it is recommended that you commit both the deleted and added items at the same time.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Repairing a Broken Rename</h2>
  <p>Generally speaking, a working copy item should always be moved or renamed using a Subversion client such as Cornerstone. This allows Subversion to track the change and ensure that the history of the item is not lost.</p>
  <p>However, some tools may automatically rename items in a manner that the user has no control over. Such untracked renames confuse Subversion: it interprets the original item as missing and the new item as unversioned. This applies both to renames and moves (renames are just a special type of move where the original and new locations are in the same folder).</p>
  <p>Cornerstone provides the <span class="uiref">Repair Broken Rename</span> command that can be used to fix broken renames by telling Subversion that a pair of missing and unversioned files should be interpreted as a rename.</p>
  <p>To repair a broken rename:</p>
  <div class="task">
	  <ol>
		  <li>Select both the missing and unversioned files in the working copy. The <span class="uiref">CHANGED</span> filter can be used to locate these items.</li>
		  <li>These should be the only files selected.</li>
		  <li>Select <span class="uiref">Repair Broken Rename</span> from the <span class="uiref">Working Copy</span> menu or click the button in the browser's toolbar:
  			<p>
	  			<div class="view-button">
	  				<img src="../../../images/toolbar-repair-move.png" srcset="../../../images/toolbar-repair-move@2x.png 2x"/>
						<p>Repair</p>
	  			</div>
	  		</p>
		  </li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="note">
		<p>The title of the repair command is <span class="uiref">Repair Broken Move</span> when the missing and unversioned items are located in different folders.</p>
